Financial Feature Optimization for Corporate Bankruptcy Prediction
Using Gradient Boosting Models on the Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset

📌 Project Overview

This project investigates which financial indicators are most influential in predicting corporate bankruptcy, and how techniques like feature selection, dimensionality reduction, and hyperparameter tuning affect model performance.

I used the Polish Companies Bankruptcy Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which contains financial ratios for companies 1–5 years prior to bankruptcy.

My goal was to:

Identify key financial predictors of bankruptcy

Evaluate how boosting models perform across different forecast horizons

Analyze how PCA and preprocessing improve interpretability

Compare model performance between baseline and optimized versions

🧪 Research Question

“Which financial indicators most influence bankruptcy prediction, and how does feature selection affect model performance across different years?"

📊 Dataset

Source: UCI ML Repository
🔗 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/365/polish+companies+bankruptcy+data

The dataset is split into five files:

Dataset	Horizon	Rows	Features
1year.arff	Bankruptcy next year	7027	64
2year.arff	2-year horizon	10,500+	64
3year.arff	3-year horizon	10,800+	64
4year.arff	4-year horizon	9,000+	64
5year.arff	5-year horizon	8,000+	64

The class imbalance is severe (≈3–5% bankrupt firms), making this a challenging real-world classification problem.

🛠 Methodology
✔ Data Preprocessing

I applied a fully automated, multi-step pipeline:

Median imputation (missing values reduced to 0)

Outlier removal using IQR-based clipping

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Dimensionality reduction with PCA (95% variance retained)

Class imbalance correction using SMOTE

🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

I evaluated three gradient boosting models:

1. XGBoost

Handles imbalance well

Strong non-linear modeling

Best mid-term predictor (2–4 years)

2. LightGBM

Fast, memory efficient

Best short-term model (1-year dataset)

Best 2-year model after tuning

3. CatBoost

Handles noisy and correlated features

Best long-term model (5-year dataset)

🔧 Hyperparameter Tuning

I optimized all models using:

RandomizedSearchCV → broad search

GridSearchCV → fine-tuning

5-fold cross-validation

AUC used as primary metric (due to heavy imbalance)

📈 Best Results After Tuning
Dataset	Best Model	AUC
1-Year	LightGBM	0.667
2-Year	LightGBM	0.609
3-Year	XGBoost	0.626
4-Year	XGBoost	0.655
5-Year	CatBoost	0.816

📌 Conclusion:

Short-term predictions → LightGBM

Mid-term predictions → XGBoost

Long-term predictions → CatBoost

No single model dominates across all horizons, proving financial patterns change over time.

⭐ Feature Importance Analysis

I extracted top features from each model and built a cross-year feature importance matrix.

Key indicators consistently appearing across years:

Attr15 – profitability/efficiency metric

Attr21 – debt servicing capacity

Attr37 – long-term financial stability

Attr59 – liquidity & leverage indicator

These represent stable, long-term signals of financial distress.

📉 Visualizations Included

All plots are generated via Python (Matplotlib + Seaborn).

🧾 Results Summary

Boosting models outperform classical ML methods on this dataset

Preprocessing (SMOTE + PCA) significantly improves model stability

Feature importance varies by horizon, but key indicators remain consistent

CatBoost and XGBoost excel at long-horizon forecasting

LightGBM gives the best short-term interpretability and accuracy
